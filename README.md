# Icenado Spell README

## Introduction
The following file allows you to create the 'icenado' spell, which was required for Question 5 of the test. This file, when placed in the `forgottenserver/data/scripts/spells` directory, enables the generation of a spell with the words 'exevo nado' introduced through the text input client.

## Compatibility
This spell will only work with the druid and sorcerer vocations because it was registered for those two.

## Installation
1. Download the `icenado.lua` file.
2. Place the `icenado.lua` file in the `forgottenserver/data/scripts/spells` directory of your Forgotten Server installation.

## Usage
After installation, players with druid or sorcerer vocations can cast the 'icenado' spell by typing 'exevo nado' in the text input client.

## Credits
This spell was created by Flabord
